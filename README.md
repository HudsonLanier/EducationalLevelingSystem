# EducationalLevelingSystem

This program is a leveling system designed initially for learning pieces of music. Users can enter in information about the piece of music that they are playing, and the program will ask them a series of progressively more difficult prompts until the piece is learned. Each prompt is asked 5 times in a row, and is considered completed when the user answers 'y' all five times (meaning that they successfully performed the task 5 times in a row). Any other input from the user, and the failed prompt will be asked again at a later time until all of the tasks are completed. As prompts for a given level are completed, the level of the piece is raised, and more difficult prompts are given.

When main.py is run, I have set the program up to run a sample demonstration for a training session on an excerpt for Don Juan to illustrate what the program does.
